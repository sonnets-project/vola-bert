# Vola-BERT

This code repository contains an extend version for our proposed model, Vola-BERT, where we allow for a flexible number of semantic tokens, not limited to market sessions and economic events.

## Model Specification
Semantic tokens are specified via a dictionary mapping each token name to its number of token types. For example, in our initial experiments, we use 5 market sessions and 3 impact events, defining the model as follows:
```
model = Vola_BERT(
          **{
              'input_len': input_len,
              'pred_len': pred_len,
              'n_layer': n_layer,
              'num_series': num_series,
              'semantic_tokens': {'market_session': 5, 'event': 3}
          }
        )
```
For input shapes and training procedure, we provide a demo notebooks containing input examples as well as training code.
